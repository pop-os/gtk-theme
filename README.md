- For fonts, use:
 > Window Titles: Fira Sans SemiBold 10

 > Interface: Fira Sans Book 10

 > Documents: Roboto Slab Regular 11

 > Monospace: Fira Mono Regular 11


### Installation

Pop is intended to be installed through the package manager. Packages for Ubuntu are available in PPA:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:system76/pop
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pop-theme
```
It's recommended to use the `pop-theme` metapackage, as this will pull in all components of the look. However, individual components can be installed separately, e.g:
```
sudo apt install pop-gtk-theme
```
It's also recommended to restart the GNOME Shell after applying the theme of your choice.

Enter the Shell's command launcher
```
Alt + F2
```

This will restart the Shell after you hit Enter
```
r
```
