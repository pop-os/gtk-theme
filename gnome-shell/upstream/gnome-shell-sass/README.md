# GNOME Shell Sass
GNOME Shell Sass is a project intended to allow the sharing of the
theme sources in sass between gnome-shell and other projects like
gnome-shell-extensions.

Any changes should be done in the [GNOME Shell subtree][shell-subtree]
and not the stand-alone [gnome-shell-sass repository][sass-repo]. They
will then be synchronized periodically before releases.
