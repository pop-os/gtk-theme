## Pop Sound Theme Source

The source file is the .mmpz file; it's a standard LMMS project, and uses only default instruments and effects. It was created in LMMS 1.2, but it may work in LMMS 1.1.3 as well. 
Each different sound is its own track, and there's a segment for each sound. It's easiest to render all of the sounds as one file, and split them up in an audio editor (e.g. Audacity) later. Be sure to apply a compressor and to normalize the sounds to ensure that chords aren't excessively loud and single-notes aren't too quiet. The ideal peak seems to be close to 0.6-ish in Audacity.
